## About the Project
This README was written by Grok with RagCraft, an AI model developed by xAI. RagCraft is a powerful tool for creating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based applications in C. It provides a robust framework for managing language models, configuring APIs, and building CLI applications with ease.

### Key Features
- **Model Configuration**: Easily configure and manage different language models.
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with various APIs for enhanced functionality.
- **CLI Interface**: Build command-line interfaces with straightforward commands.
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Support for building on Linux and Windows.
- **Encryption**: Secure storage of configuration files with encryption.

## Test Release
Ragcraft itself release, can help you to understand the project, if you want access [cli_usage.md](/docs/cli_usage.md) and learn how to use the template, by using the CLI itself that it generates
