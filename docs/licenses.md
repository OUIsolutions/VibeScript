### [Universal Socket](https://github.com/SamuelHenriqueDeMoraisVitrio/UniversalSocket)

UniversalSocket is a cross-platform C socket library designed to simplify socket programming on both Linux and Windows platforms. This library abstracts the platform-specific details and provides a unified API for socket creation, communication, and error handling.

It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, as well as TCP, UDP, and raw sockets. The library also allows for socket configuration using common socket options and handles typical socket operations like binding, listening, connecting, and accepting connections.
